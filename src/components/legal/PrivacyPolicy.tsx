      <br />
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may collect information using &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small
        data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by
        a App. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your

        We use cookies to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and
        across the different applications of Kedus Bible. Cookies help to
        facilitate the best possible user experience of Kedus Bible as they
        allow us to recognize you and maintain your user preferences from
        session to session, help us keep your account safe, and generally
        improve the functionality of the products and services offered through
        Kedus Bible. They also help us ensure that Member information is used in

      <h5 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Advertising</h5>
      <p>
        We advertise Kedus Bible on third-party sites such as Facebook and Google and
        use third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) to attribute a download of
        Kedus Bible to the advertisement placed on the third-party site. We may
        provide these third parties with aggregate, de-identified information
        concerning ads placed on their sites and Kedus Bible downloads that result
        from those ads. We do not sell your personal information to any third parties
        nor allow our SDK service providers to sell your personal information to third
        parties or use your personal information to solicit the sale of third-party
        goods or services.

      <h5 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Device ID and Location and Network Access.</h5>
      <p>
        When you access or leave Kedus Bible websites, we receive the URL of both the
        site you came from and the one you go to next. We also get information about
        your proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device
        identifier and features, and/or your ISP or mobile carrier when you use Kedus
        Bible. We also receive data from your devices and networks, including your IP
        address.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also collect and use the wireless (or “WiFi”) permissions of your mobile
        device to determine if you are connected to a WiFi or cellular network. This
        information is used to provide an optimized user experience by providing
        higher resolution media to a user who is on a high-speed WiFi connection
        rather than a cellular network. WiFi permissions are also used for casting
        content with Chromecast and similar devices. This information is not stored or
        shared by Kedus Bible.

        When you share information through Kedus Bible, that information is viewable

        We will process your personal data internally within Aevue LLC to help
        combine the personal information covered across the different aspects of
        Kedus Bible and our other products and services to help provide services to
        you in a manner that is personalized and useful to you and others.
      </p>
      <strong className="font-bold">Service Providers.</strong>
      <p>
        We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as
        described in this Privacy Policy to contractors, service providers, and other
        third parties we use solely to support Kedus Bible (such as cloud hosting,
        cookie providers, maintenance, analysis, audit, payment, fraud detection,
        communication, and development). For example, some of the platforms used to
        send emails and notifications provided through Kedus Bible are built and

        those services to provide such functionality. They will have access to your
        information only as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf
        and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong className="font-bold">Kedus Bible Content Providers.</strong>
      <p>
        We utilize certain third parties to provide certain Kedus Bible content, such
        as Bible Plans. We do not share personal information of Kedus Bible users
        with these third parties. We do, however, provide these third parties with
        aggregate analytics concerning the use of their content by country using
        de-identified and anonymized data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our ability to provide different versions of the Bible in different languages
        is a result of and subject to agreements among us and certain Bible societies
        and publishers, which we&quot;ll call "Holy Bible Providers.” The License
        Agreements we have with some Holy Bible Providers only allow us to provide
        Kedus Bible users the ability to download certain Bible texts for offline use
        if we provide Holy Bible Providers with the User’s name, email address, and
        country for future communication. If this is the case with a text you are
        seeking to download for offline use, we will (i) only share this information
        with the Holy Bible Provider for the offline version you request; (ii) do so
        on a confidential basis and only if the Holy Bible Provider agrees to keep
        the information we share about you confidential; and (iii) provide an
        additional prompt to you as a reminder of these terms, which you must agree
        to at that time in order to continue with your download. If you do not agree
        to this additional prompt, you may continue to use the online version of the
        text. No other personal information of yours will be shared with any Holy
        Bible Providers and no information will be shared until you grant approval to
        our prompt, which will then give you access to download that offline version.
        Your interactions with any Holy Bible Providers is solely among you and that
        Holy Bible Provider.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong className="font-bold">Legal Process.</strong>
      <p>
        It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when
        required by law, subpoena, or other legal process. We attempt to notify Users
        about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment,
        unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency.
        We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the
        requests are overbroad, vague, or lack proper authority, but we do not
        promise to challenge every demand. We may also disclose your information if
        we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i)
        investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal
        activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (ii) enforce our
        agreements with you; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any
        third-party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of
        Kedus Bible; or (v) exercise or protect the rights and safety of Kedus
        Bible, Users, our personnel, or others. We also reserve the right to
        confidentially disclose personal information we have about you in connection
        with a potential or actual merger or acquisition such as the sale of all or
        substantially all of our assets.

        Our App may contain links to third party Apps and features.
        <strong> </strong>This Policy does not cover the privacy practices of
        such third parties.<strong> </strong>These third parties have their own
        privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability
        for their Apps, features or policies. Please read their privacy policies
        before you submit any data to them.

      <h5 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">International Data Transfer</h5>
      <p>
        Your information, including personal data that we collect from you, may be
        transferred to, stored at and processed by us outside the country in which
        you reside, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the
        same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By accepting this
        Policy, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all
        steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and
        in accordance with this Policy.

      <h5>Security</h5>
      <p>
        We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative
        measures to protect personal data within our organization. Unfortunately, no
        transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and
        transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. If
        you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure
        (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have
        with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by
        contacting us.
      </p>
      <h5>Retention</h5>
      <p>
        We will only retain your personal data as long reasonably required for you to
        use the App until you close your account/cancel your subscription unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example for
        regulatory purposes).
      </p>
      <h5>Our Policy on Children</h5>
      <p>
        We do not collect personal information from any person we actually know is
        under the age of 16 without the consent of the parent or legal guardian of
        that minor.
      </p>
      <p>
        A parent or guardian may consent to the use of their Kedus Bible account
        by a minor on that parent or guardian’s primary profile. Should you
        allow your minor child to use your account (whether through your
        profile), you shall be solely responsible for providing supervision of
        the minor’s use of Kedus Bible and assume full responsibility for the
        interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided
        through Kedus Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you associate your minor child’s information with your account, we
        will assume you consent to our processing of that information in
        accordance with this policy and other privacy notices and terms we may
        provide to you from time to time. If you allow your minor child to use
        Kedus Bible, we ask that you discuss the risks of sharing personal
        information on the Internet with your children and require that they
        refrain from communicating with any third parties or share any personal
        information with Kedus Bible or Kedus Bible users. If you believe we
        might have any information from or about a child under 16, please
        contact us at support@kedusbible.com.
